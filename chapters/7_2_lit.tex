\section{WebAssembly}
\label{sec:webassembly}

\subsection{Overview and Motivation}
\label{subsec:wasm-overview}

\acrfull{wasm} is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages~\cite{rossberg2018webassembly, wasm_specs, w3c2022wasm2}. It was originally developed to enable near-native execution performance of code in web browsers. \acrshort{wasm} emerged from a collaborative effort by engineers from the four major browser vendors (Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Apple) to address the performance limitations of JavaScript while preserving the security and portability characteristics essential for web execution.

However, developers quickly recognized that \acrshort{wasm}'s unique combination of performance, security, and portability extended far beyond browser environments. Its sandboxed execution model enables near-native performance across diverse hardware architectures while maintaining strict security guarantees. These properties proved particularly valuable for embedded systems and \acrshort{iot} devices, where code must execute safely on resource-constrained hardware.

The introduction of the \acrfull{wasi} marked a pivotal transition from web-centric to general-purpose computing. \acrshort{wasi} provides standardized \acrshort{api} for functionalities such as filesystem access, clocks, and proposals for networking and system interactions, enabling \acrshort{wasm} modules to operate independently of browsers. The capability-based security model inherent in \acrshort{wasi} further addresses critical concerns in embedded deployments, where unauthorized access to hardware peripherals could compromise device functionality or user safety.

This evolution has proven timely. Critical infrastructure software and consumer products --- ranging from baby monitors to smartwatches --- have created unprecedented demand for technology that is secure, reliable, and easily updatable while requiring minimal overhead. Regulatory frameworks such as the European Parliament's Cyber Resilience Act~\cite{eu_cyber_res_act} further emphasize this need, as they oblige manufacturers to handle vulnerabilities effectively during support periods and to provide security updates throughout a product's expected lifespan. \acrshort{wasm}'s ability to deliver secure, cross-platform execution with straightforward update mechanisms positions it as a promising solution for these emerging requirements in safety-critical and resource-constrained environments.

\subsection{The WebAssembly Ecosystem}
\label{subsec:wasm-ecosystem}

The \acrshort{wasm} ecosystem comprises several components that enable the development, compilation, and execution of \acrshort{wasm} applications. These components include:

\textbf{Compilation Toolchains:} Several compilers can target \acrshort{wasm}, including Emscripten for C/C++~\cite{emscripten_git}, the Rust compiler with Tier~2 support~\cite{rust_wasm_target}, \texttt{wasi-sdk}~\cite{wasisdk}, and specialized tools such as AssemblyScript~\cite{assemblyscript_git}. These toolchains translate high-level languages into \acrshort{wasm} bytecode while managing language-specific runtime requirements.

\textbf{Runtime Environments:} \acrshort{wasm} can execute in browsers through built-in JavaScript engines such as V8~\cite{v8_wasm}. In addition, standalone runtimes like \acrshort{wamr}, Wasmtime, and Wasmer support server-side and embedded applications. These runtimes provide the execution environment and implement the \acrshort{wasm} specification~\cite{wasm_specs}.

\textbf{Development Tools:} The ecosystem includes debugging tools, profilers, and analysis frameworks that support \acrshort{wasm} development. Utilities such as \texttt{wasm-tools}~\cite{wasm_tools_git} and WABT (WebAssembly Binary Toolkit)~\cite{wabt_git} enable tasks like validation, disassembly, and binary inspection of \acrshort{wasm} modules.

\textbf{Standards and Governance:} \acrshort{wasm} development follows the W3C standardization process. Its evolution is coordinated through the WebAssembly Community Group and the W3C WebAssembly Working Group, ensuring that the technology advances in a consensus-driven and vendor-neutral manner.

\section{The WebAssembly System Interface}
\label{sec:wasi}

\subsection{Fundamentals}
\label{subsec:wasi-fundamentals}

\acrfull{wasi} represents a crucial evolution in \acrshort{wasm}'s capabilities, extending the platform beyond browser environments to enable execution in servers, edge devices, and embedded systems~\cite{wasi_mozilla_blog}. \acrshort{wasi} functions as a system interface for a conceptual operating system, providing a standardized way for \acrshort{wasm} modules to interact with system resources while preserving the security and portability characteristics that define the technology.

\acrshort{wasi} emerged from the need for \acrshort{wasm} programs outside the browser to interact with the underlying system. \acrshort{wasi} aims to provide this by defining a modular set of \acrshort{api}s --- through proposals --- that enable access to filesystems, networking, cryptographic functions, hardware interfaces, and more~\cite{wasi_proposals}.

The design philosophy of \acrshort{wasi} centers on capability-based security, where access to system resources is mediated through explicitly granted permissions rather than implicit, ambient authority (such as unrestricted filesystem access). This ensures that \acrshort{wasm} modules can only interact with resources explicitly provided by the host environment, thereby maintaining strong isolation and security even in server and embedded contexts.

\subsection{WASI Preview 1}
\label{subsec:wasi-preview1}
Preview 1 was the first stabilized release of \acrfull{wasi}, focused on providing fundamental system interaction capabilities. It employed WITX~\cite{witx_docs} as its \acrfull{idl}~\cite{idl}, an experimental language designed specifically for expressing \acrshort{wasi} \acrshort{api}s. WITX, based on S-expressions~\cite{sexpressions} and inspired by the WebAssembly Text (WAT) format~\cite{wat}, followed a function-oriented model closely resembling traditional system call interfaces. Although effective, WITX has since been deprecated in favor of the more flexible \acrshort{wit} format.

The design of Preview 1 drew heavily from POSIX conventions, implementing familiar concepts such as file descriptors, path-based file operations, and process-centric resource management. Its \acrshort{api} included essential system operations such as file handling (open, close, read, write), clocks and timers, random number generation, environment variable access, and command-line argument parsing.

Preview 1 saw widespread adoption thanks to its stability and practical utility. However, the WITX-based design revealed several fundamental limitations, including limited expressiveness and lack of modularity. These shortcomings motivated the \acrshort{wasi} Subgroup to transition toward the more sophisticated \acrshort{wit} format and the Preview 2 architecture:

\textbf{Limited Language Support:} WITX primarily targeted C-like languages and lacked the expressiveness to support a broader range of programming paradigms. Its design assumptions made it difficult to generate idiomatic bindings for languages with richer memory models, type systems, or runtime features.


\textbf{Restricted Type Expressiveness:} WITX offered only basic type safety, with limited support for strings and arrays, and no way to model complex return values. Functions typically returned success or failure via the \texttt{expected} construct, while actual data was passed through pointer parameters. This C-style pattern complicated memory management and hindered the design of clean, language-agnostic \acrshort{api}s.

\textbf{Monolithic Structure:} Preview 1 exposed a relatively monolithic API surface that was difficult to extend, compose, or virtualize. This lack of modularity prevented fine-grained capability management and made it impossible to define specialized subsets of the \acrshort{api} for targeted use cases.

These shortcomings led to the introduction of the more powerful \acrshort{wit} format and the component model in \acrshort{wasi} Preview 2. With this transition, WITX is now considered a legacy format and is no longer actively maintained.

\subsection{WASI Preview 2 and the Component Model}
\label{subsec:wasi-preview2}

Preview 2 constitutes a comprehensive redesign of \acrshort{wasi}. Whereas Preview 1 suffered from limited type expressiveness, poor language support, and a monolithic \acrshort{api} surface, Preview 2 introduces a modular architecture with advanced capabilities for component composition, virtualization, and language interoperability.

\textbf{Component Model:} A central innovation of Preview 2 is the Component Model~\cite{wasi_component_model}, which enables the composition of \acrshort{wasm} modules through well-defined interfaces. Components can both export and import functionality via standardized \acrshort{wit}-based descriptions, facilitating language interoperability and supporting complex application architectures with multiple interacting components.

\textbf{Resource-Based Design:} Unlike Preview 1â€™s function-oriented \acrshort{api}s, Preview 2 adopts a resource-based design in which system entities (e.g., files, sockets, or \acrshort{i2c} devices) are modeled as first-class resources with associated methods. This model improves encapsulation, enables automatic resource management, strengthens type safety, and aligns with capability-based security principles.

\textbf{WIT Interface Definition:} Preview 2 adopts the \acrshort{wit} format for defining interfaces. \acrshort{wit} supports complex data structures, resource types, and interface composition. Tooling such as \sloppy\texttt{wit-bindgen} can automatically generate idiomatic bindings for multiple programming languages, thereby improving developer productivity and interoperability.

\textbf{Capability-Based Security Enhancement:} The component model extends \acrshort{wasi}'s capability-based security by introducing fine-grained control over resource access and enabling explicit capability delegation between components. This design supports advanced scenarios such as capability attenuation, resource multiplexing, and policy enforcementâ€”features particularly relevant in multi-tenant or embedded \acrshort{iot} environments.

\subsection{Differences and Trade-offs between Preview 1 and Preview 2}
\label{subsec:preview-differences}
The transition from Preview 1 to Preview 2 introduces significant differences and trade-offs. While Preview 2 improves expressiveness, modularity, and language interoperability, these advances also affect runtime implementation complexity, performance characteristics, and deployment scenarios:

\textbf{Memory Architecture:} Preview 1 and Preview 2 adopt fundamentally different approaches to memory management and inter-module communication. Preview 1 follows a shared-memory model, where modules exchange data through exported linear memory and raw pointer manipulation. \acrshort{api}s mutate caller-provided buffers directly, which requires modules to share a memory space for data exchange. In contrast, Preview 2 implements a strict shared-nothing architecture: each component instance encapsulates its own memory, tables, globals, and functions. Components interact exclusively through import/export boundaries defined in \acrshort{wit}, ensuring safer isolation, better type safety, and improved language interoperability.

\textbf{Implementation Complexity:} The component model in Preview 2 introduces significant complexity for runtime implementers. Supporting component instantiation, interface resolution, resource management, and the shared-nothing linking model requires a more sophisticated infrastructure than Preview 1â€™s relatively simple function dispatch with shared memory access. Furthermore, the transition from raw pointer-based interfaces to high-level type abstractions necessitates additional translation layers and the full implementation of the Canonical \acrfull{abi}~\cite{abi}~\cite{cabi}, which may increase runtime overhead.

\textbf{Development Experience:} For developers, Preview 2 offers a significantly enhanced experience through automatic binding generation, improved type safety, and stronger tooling support. By eliminating raw pointer manipulation, it mitigates common security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and out-of-bounds memory access.

\textbf{Performance Implications:} The contrasting architectures of Preview 1 and Preview 2 lead to distinct performance characteristics. Preview 1â€™s shared-memory model allows efficient data exchange through direct pointer manipulation and zero-copy operations within a common address space. By contrast, Preview 2 employs the Canonical \acrshort{abi}, which specifies how high-level component types are represented as low-level \acrshort{wasm} types. Although the specification describes lifting and lowering operations that may seem to introduce intermediate copies, practical implementations often fuse these into efficient direct transfers between component memory spaces. The Canonical \acrshort{abi} is further optimized to avoid redundant copying, especially for immutable data structures that can be shared safely. Nonetheless, actual performance depends strongly on the chosen data types, mutability requirements, and component design. In addition, Preview 2â€™s resource-based model and component instantiation overhead can increase startup latency compared to Preview 1â€™s direct function-call approach, an effect particularly relevant in constrained environments and short-lived workloads.

\section{Binding Generation}
\label{sec:wit-binding}

\subsection{Binding Generation Process}
\label{subsec:binding-generation}

Binding generation transforms \acrshort{wit} interface definitions into language-specific code that enables type-safe access to WebAssembly component functionality. This process typically involves multiple stages that ensure correct data marshaling (encoding/serialization and decoding/deserialization) across component boundaries while preserving the semantic properties defined in the \acrshort{wit} interface. In practice, tools such as \texttt{wit-bindgen} automate this workflow for a wide range of programming languages~\cite{wit_bindgen_git}.

\textbf{Interface Analysis:} The binding generator parses \acrshort{wit} definitions to extract type information, resource dependencies, and interface relationships. This analysis phase validates the interface definition and constructs an intermediate representation suitable for code generation.

\textbf{Type Mapping:} In the second stage, \acrshort{wit} types are mapped to idiomatic representations in the target language. For example, a \texttt{u32} in \acrshort{wit} may be mapped to \texttt{u32} in Rust, \texttt{int} in C, or \texttt{number} in JavaScript. The goal is to balance semantic fidelity with a natural developer experience in the chosen language.

\textbf{Marshaling Code Generation:} In this stage, the generator produces code that converts between language-native types and their Canonical \acrshort{abi} representations for inter-component communication. This marshaling is bidirectional, ensuring that both host-to-guest and guest-to-host calls are correctly translated. It includes handling of complex data structures, resource handles, and error propagation across component boundaries.

\textbf{Resource Management Integration:} Finally, the generator aligns resource lifecycle management with the conventions of the target language. In garbage-collected languages such as Java or Python, this involves integrating with the runtimeâ€™s memory management system. In contrast, languages like Rust rely on explicit ownership and \acrfull{raii} semantics, where the generator ensures that imported and exported resources are correctly created, transferred, and dropped at well-defined points in the programâ€™s execution.

Popular binding generation tools include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{wit-bindgen:} The primary reference implementation that generates idiomatic bindings for multiple target languages including Rust, C, JavaScript, and Python~\cite{wit_bindgen_git}. It is widely adopted in the component model ecosystem.
    \item \textbf{Wasmtime bindgen macro:} A Rust-specific integration that provides compile-time binding generation directly within the Wasmtime runtime, enabling seamless use of \acrshort{wit}-defined interfaces in Rust projects~\cite{wasmtime_bindgen_docs}.
    \item \textbf{jco:} A JavaScript-focused tool that simplifies component development and execution in Node.js and browser environments~\cite{jco_docs}.
    \item \textbf{wasm-tools:} A broader toolkit maintained by the Bytecode Alliance that provides validation, parsing, and transformation utilities, including support for \acrshort{wit} integration~\cite{wasm_tools_git}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Binding Generation vs Manual Implementation}
\label{subsec:binding-comparison}

The decision between relying on automatic binding generation and opting for manual interface implementation introduces trade-offs across multiple dimensions, including development efficiency, runtime performance, and overall implementation complexity. While automatic tools provide rapid development and reduce the likelihood of errors, manual implementations allow for fine-grained control at the cost of increased effort and potential maintenance overhead.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|C{2.1cm}|C{6cm}|C{6cm}|}
    \hline
            & \textbf{Automatic Binding Generation} & \textbf{Manual Implementation} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Development Efficiency} & Eliminates manual interface interpretation, prone to errors. Enables rapid prototyping and higher reliability. & Requires handwritten marshaling logic and careful error handling. Higher initial effort and increased chance of bugs. \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Type Safety} & Provides compile-time type safety guarantees. & Relies on developer discipline to ensure correct type conversions. \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Performance} & May include some abstraction overhead, but benefits from systematic optimization in the generator. & Can be optimized for specific use cases and low-level constraints, potentially achieving lower overhead. \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Maintenance} & Automatically adapts to interface changes when regenerating bindings. & Requires manual updates whenever the interface evolves. Long-term maintenance burden. \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Runtime Compatibility} & May require sophisticated runtime capabilities (e.g., Preview 2 features) & Can be tailored to specific runtimes, \acrshort{wasi} versions or environments, offering maximal flexibility. \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}

\section{WebAssembly Runtimes}
\label{sec:wasm-runtimes}

\subsection{Runtime Architecture and Design Principles}
\label{subsec:runtime-architecture}

WebAssembly runtimes provide the execution environment for \acrshort{wasm} modules and components, offering infrastructure for loading, validating, compiling, and executing code. Architectural decisions differ between runtimes and strongly influence performance, resource usage, and deployment suitability~\cite{wasm_features_support}.

The fundamental components of a typical WebAssembly runtime include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Module Loader and Validator:} Parses the WebAssembly binary format, validates module structure and type safety, and ensures compliance with WebAssemblyâ€™s security guarantees.
    \item \textbf{Execution Engine:} Implements WebAssemblyâ€™s execution semantics through interpretation, \acrfull{jit} compilation, or \acrfull{aot} compilation. The chosen strategy affects startup latency, memory footprint, and steady-state performance.
    \item \textbf{Memory Management:} Manages WebAssemblyâ€™s linear memory model, including allocation, growth, and bounds checking. Linear memory differs from conventional memory layouts by exposing a single contiguous address space to the guest.
    \item \textbf{Host Interface:} Provides controlled access to system resources via \acrshort{wasi} or custom host functions, enabling I/O and integration with native libraries.
    \item \textbf{Security Sandbox:} Enforces isolation between the WebAssembly module and the host, preventing out-of-bounds memory access and restricting system calls to a well-defined capability model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wasmtime}
\label{subsec:wasmtime}

Wasmtime is a production-ready runtime maintained by the Bytecode Alliance and is widely regarded as the reference implementation for \acrshort{wasi} and the WebAssembly Component Model~\cite{wasmtime_project}. Its architecture emphasizes standards compliance, security, and developer experience, making it the primary choice for developing \acrshort{wasi} Preview~2 applications.

\textbf{Cranelift Code Generation:} Wasmtime uses Cranelift, a compiler backend designed for security and fast compilation speed while providing competitive runtime performance~\cite{cranelift}. Cranelift supports both \acrshort{jit} compilation for dynamic workloads and \acrshort{aot} compilation for deployment scenarios requiring lower startup latency.

\textbf{Language Integration:} Wasmtime provides high-quality libraries for multiple host languages, including Rust, C/C++, Python, and JavaScript. This broad ecosystem integration facilitates embedding Wasmtime into diverse application environments and frameworks.

\subsection{WebAssembly Micro Runtime}
\label{subsec:wamr}

\acrfull{wamr} is a lightweight and portable WebAssembly runtime specifically designed for embedded devices, \acrshort{iot} applications, and resource-constrained environments~\cite{wamr_project, wamr_project2}. Its architecture prioritizes minimal resource usage, fast startup, and broad platform compatibility, making it suitable for deployment scenarios where memory and processing resources are limited.

\textbf{Lightweight Design Philosophy:} WAMR minimizes memory footprint and startup overhead, which are essential for embedded deployments. This distinguishes it from general-purpose runtimes such as Wasmtime.

\textbf{Execution Engine Options:} WAMR supports multiple execution strategies, including interpretation, Classic \acrshort{jit}, Fast \acrshort{jit}, and \acrshort{aot} compilation. The execution mode can be configured to match the performance and resource constraints of the target device. For example, \acrshort{aot} compilation is often preferred for microcontrollers, where runtime compilation would be impractical.

\textbf{Platform Portability:} WAMR runs on a wide range of platforms, including popular microcontroller architectures (e.g., ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V), real-time operating systems such as Zephyr and FreeRTOS, and constrained Linux environments. This versatility enables adoption in diverse embedded use cases.

\textbf{WASI Preview 1 Focus:} WAMR primarily supports \acrshort{wasi} Preview~1, which aligns with the stability and simplicity requirements of embedded applications. While Preview~2 support is under consideration, Preview~1 remains the main interface for production deployments. This Preview~1 focus is a key reason for using WAMR in this research, since it necessitates the development of custom bindings for the \acrshort{i2c} interface.


\section{I2C Protocol and Embedded Systems}
\label{sec:i2c-embedded}

\subsection{Protocol Fundamentals}
\label{subsec:i2c-fundamentals}

The \acrfull{i2c} protocol is a multi-controller\footnote{Following the updated terminology "controller/target" instead of "master/slave" to align with the MIPI I3C specification and NXP's Inclusive Language Project~\cite{i2c_specification}.}, multi-target serial communication bus widely used in embedded systems for connecting microcontrollers with peripheral devices~\cite{i2c_specification}. Developed by Philips Semiconductor (now part of NXP Semiconductors) in the early 1980s, \acrshort{i2c} has become a fundamental communication protocol in \acrshort{iot} ecosystems, sensor networks, and embedded control systems. Although the specification allows for multiple controllers, most practical implementations rely on a single controller with multiple targets.

The protocol operates over two bidirectional signal lines: the \textbf{Serial Data Line (SDA)}, which carries the data being transmitted, and the \textbf{Serial Clock Line (SCL)}, which provides the clock signal controlled by the initiating controller. Both lines are implemented as open-drain outputs with pull-up resistors, enabling multiple devices to share the same bus safely.

\subsection{I2C Communication Mechanisms}
\label{subsec:i2c-communication}

\textbf{Device Addressing:} Each target device on the \acrshort{i2c} bus has a unique address, typically 7 bits in length. Although a 10-bit addressing mode exists, it is less common in practice.

\textbf{START, Repeated START, and STOP Conditions:} Communication sessions begin with a START condition and end with a STOP condition, both defined by transitions on SDA while SCL is high. A repeated START allows a controller to retain bus control without releasing it, which is frequently used in read transactions.

\textbf{Acknowledgment Mechanism:} Each transmitted byte must be acknowledged (ACK) by the receiving device. A missing acknowledgment (NACK) indicates either that no device responded at the specified address, or that the controller has signaled the end of the transfer.





\textbf{Multi-Controller Support:} The \acrshort{i2c} protocol includes arbitration mechanisms allowing multiple controllers to coexist on the same bus. Arbitration ensures that when two controllers attempt simultaneous communication, only one retains control without corrupting data. In practice, however, most \acrshort{i2c} systems are deployed with a single controller~\cite{i2c_specification}.

\subsection{Hardware Abstraction Layers}
\label{subsec:hal-embedded}

\acrfull{hal}s provide portable interfaces to access hardware peripherals, abstracting device-specific details behind generic \acrshort{api}s. This decoupling allows driver code to operate across different microcontroller families and platforms~\cite{hal}.  

In the Rust ecosystem, the \texttt{embedded-hal} crate~\cite{embedded_hal_crate} has become the de facto standard, defining traits for common peripherals such as \acrshort{i2c}, SPI, GPIO, and UART. Numerous driver crates build on these traits, ensuring cross-platform portability. Platform-specific implementations include \texttt{linux-embedded-hal}~\cite{linux_embedded_hal_crate} for Linux systems and other crates targeting Raspberry Pi~\cite{rppal_crate} or STM32 microcontrollers~\cite{stm_hal_crate}.

\section{WASI I2C Standardization Proposal}
\label{sec:wasi-i2c-proposal}

\subsection{Standardization Process and Current Status}
\label{subsec:i2c-standardization-process}

The \acrshort{wasi} \acrshort{i2c} proposal is part of the ongoing effort to standardize hardware communication interfaces within the \acrshort{wasi} specification~\cite{wasi_i2c_proposal}. Standardization in the \acrshort{wasi} subgroup follows a structured process with multiple phases: conceptual start (Phase 0), exploratory design (Phase 1), prototyping and specification drafting (Phase 2), implementation and integration (Phase 3), and final standardization (Phase 4-5).  

The \acrshort{i2c} proposal is currently in Phase~2, focusing on prototyping, implementation feasibility, and iterative design refinement. To advance to Phase~3, it must demonstrate comprehensive test coverage, resolve open design questions, and show multiple independent implementations.

\subsection{Proposal Architecture and Design}
\label{subsec:i2c-proposal-design}

The \acrshort{wasi} \acrshort{i2c} proposal~\cite{wasi_i2c_proposal} defines an interface inspired by the design principles of \texttt{embedded-hal} v1~\cite{hal}, while adapting them to the \acrshort{wasm} Component Model's resource-based architecture. The proposal consists of three primary \acrshort{wit} files that together form a modular and composable interface design:

\textbf{Core Interface Components:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{i2c.wit:} Defines the primary \acrshort{i2c} communication interface, including transaction operations, read/write methods, and error handling.
    \item \textbf{delay.wit:} Provides timing and delay functionality required for \acrshort{i2c} protocol compliance and device timing requirements.
    \item \textbf{world.wit:} Specifies the complete interface surface that components must either implement or import.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Resource-Based Design:} The proposal implements \acrshort{i2c} controllers as first-class resources in the Component Model, enabling proper lifetime management and capability-based security. This design ensures that \acrshort{i2c} access is mediated through explicit capability grants rather than ambient authority.

\textbf{Error Handling Strategy:} The interface defines comprehensive error types that cover common \acrshort{i2c} failure modes such as bus errors, arbitration loss, and acknowledgment failures. In addition, device-specific conditions (e.g., a non-existent register address being accessed or a timeout during EEPROM operations) are modeled explicitly. This detailed error modeling enables robust error recovery and diagnostic capabilities.

\textbf{Operation Support:} The interface supports both simple read/write operations and complex transaction sequences, enabling efficient communication patterns required by various \acrshort{i2c} devices and protocols.

\subsection{Portability Criteria}
\label{subsec:i2c-portability}

To be viable as a standardized interface, the \acrshort{wasi} \acrshort{i2c} proposal must satisfy portability criteria that demonstrate applicability across diverse implementation environments and hardware platforms. Table~\ref{tab:portability_criteria} summarizes the minimal platforms selected to validate cross-architecture support.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}



\subsection{Integration with Embedded-HAL Principles}
\label{subsec:i2c-embedded-hal-integration}

The \acrshort{wasi} \acrshort{i2c} proposal deliberately aligns with the design principles of the \acrshort{hal} project~\cite{hal}, ensuring compatibility with the existing Rust embedded ecosystem and leveraging proven interface abstractions. This alignment facilitates adoption by embedded developers and enables reuse of existing device driver implementations.

\textbf{Trait Compatibility:} The \acrshort{wit}-based interface design closely maps to the \texttt{embedded-hal} \acrshort{i2c} traits. This enables straightforward adaptation of existing drivers to the \acrshort{wasi} \acrshort{i2c} interface through thin wrapper implementations, minimizing the need for substantial code changes.

\textbf{Error Model Alignment:} The proposalâ€™s error handling strategy follows the conventions established in \texttt{embedded-hal}, while extending error categories to support richer diagnostics in a \acrshort{wasm} environment. For example, errors can include additional context such as bus arbitration failures or timeouts that may not be captured by traditional embedded traits.

\textbf{Operation Semantics:} Transaction semantics, addressing models, and timing requirements are defined in close correspondence with \texttt{embedded-hal} expectations. In particular, the use of the dedicated \texttt{delay.wit} interface mirrors the \texttt{DelayUs} and \texttt{DelayMs} traits, ensuring that timing-sensitive communication can be modeled consistently across both embedded and WebAssembly environments.
